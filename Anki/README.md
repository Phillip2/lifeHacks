# fontRandomizer.html

This script randomizes the style of your Anki cards.

Your should learn vocabulary without relying on the association with the font/size/style of the character,
because your brain will then connect two unrelated concept to each other. You should rather learn the 'essence' of
the character. My proposal to enforce learning the essence of characters is by changing the style of character
every time you see it. Another bonus is that every charater is something 'new', increasing the surprise effect and thus making it more fun to study.
In this way you learn like a good Machine Learning algorithm that has a diverse dataset and is optimized to generalize, not overfit. 

How to use:

1) Open Anki on the Desktop version
2) click on *Browse*
